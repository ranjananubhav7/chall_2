        <p><b>The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division, better known by its acronym
            S.H.I.E.L.D., is an American extra-governmental counter-terrorism and intelligence agency, tasked with
            maintaining both national and global security. <br>

            Founded in the wake of the Allied victory over the Axis powers and HYDRA in World War II, S.H.I.E.L.D. was
            organized to protect the United States from all possible threats. With its advanced weapons, extraordinary
            agents and its Steganography techniques, S.H.I.E.L.D. was maybe the greatest military power on Earth.
            Following his encounter with Captain Marvel, S.H.I.E.L.D. was run by Nick Fury and the World Security
            Council in the modern age, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to deal with the significant rise in enhanced individuals,
            dangerous advanced technology, and alien contact. But all the problems S.H.I.E.L.D. had to solve eventually
            led to the formation of the Avengers, a response team that was recruited to save the world during the alien
            invasion of Earth in 2012. The agency became publicly known after the Battle of New York, partially because
            of the Rising Tide website. <br>

            In 2014, through the actions of Black Widow and Nick Fury, the world became aware of the fact that
            S.H.I.E.L.D. was infiltrated and largely controlled by HYDRA. After the battle in which S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
            primary headquarters, the Triskelion, was heavily damaged, all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s classified files were
            dumped on the Internet, and the agency was disavowed by the United States government and labeled a terrorist
            organization. Many S.H.I.E.L.D. officials were taken into custody and subjected to rigorous questioning.
            However, despite the massive manhunt on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agents, a few operatives scattered across the world
            in most secret bases remained loyal to their oath, saving the most necessary technology for future use. But
            the team most responsible for the survival of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the team of Agent Phil Coulson, who valiantly
            led his teammates against the forces of HYDRA led by the traitors John Garrett and Grant Ward, winning the
            battle in which Garrett's plan ultimately failed. After that battle, Fury appointed Phil Coulson the new
            director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and tasked him with rebuilding the agency from scratch.</b></p>
